		<p>All sensors can be considered as electronic black boxes with two current electrodes and 2 voltage probes.  One or more of the connections may be missing but a careful examination of the sensor operation reveals that many operate at zero current or fixed voltage and hence the need for 4 wires often reduces to 2 wires.  A pH probe for example operates at zero current and only a voltage is measured.  Hence only two wires are required as no current is supplied.  A water conductivity probe consists of two platinum flags across which we apply an AC voltage excitation.  The flag are in series with a known resistor whose voltage drop corresponds to the measured current.  Hence 4 wires are needed but the two for current measurement are hidden in the test circuit.  If we are clever we can design an interface that connects to any type sensor. </p>
		<p>The USI is based upon a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGStat) combination along with various subcircuits for signal amplification, noise damping, level shifting and AC to DC conversion ending with an ADC and a microprocessor.  The objective is to make this system field portable.<p>
