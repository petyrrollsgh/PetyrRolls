		<p>As a chemist I wish I had a dollar (inflation mind you) for everyone that seems impressed.  I'd tack on another $10 for those who think that being an electrochemist is mind boggling.  As a student of many different fields of study, I have found each has their own language to describe exactly the same thing.  Going back to basic chemical and physical principles is often the answer.  That is what I have tried to do in my minor rant on why the essential tools of an electrochemist (the potentiostat and galvanostat) are simple amplifier feed back loops.  We as electrochemist are guilty of adding a layer of mystic to our own field in part to protect our turf and in part because we donâ€™t understand the fundamental of many of the concepts we preach.  I hope the short rant linked below helps</p>

		<p>At some later date, I may write a rant on electrochemistry for EEs.  To spoil the essence of that topic, it took me many years to understand that the transistor P/N junction was conceptually similar to a platinum electrode dunked in a salt solution.  The latter is more complex but the same fundamentals of electron energy levels and mass transport phenomena apply.</p>
