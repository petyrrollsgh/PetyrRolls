			<p>Starting a little over two years ago, I wanted to build instrumentation for an inexpensive, open-source, water quality sensor system.  As part of that effort, I had to learn many facets of Electrical Engineering; although the breadth of my learning may not qualify me for the title of “Electrical Engineer.”  I wanted to record my learning experience and describe in some detail the projects that I have completed.  Below you will find Buttons leading to various subjects including the description of the “Universal Sensor Interface” (USI) which is the major goal of the project.  The USI is intended to interface with pH, turbidity, temperature, pressure and conductivity sensors that form the core sensors used for field analysis of water quality.<p>
