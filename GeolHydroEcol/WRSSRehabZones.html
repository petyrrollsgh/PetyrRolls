		<h3>Mid-Columbia River Wetland, Riparian and Shrub-Steppe Restoration Areas</h3>
		<h1>Summary</h1>

		<p>The Columbia Basin Irrigation Project (CBIP) supports a large agricultural industry in the otherwise unproductive Shrub-Steppe ecosystem in the Mid-Columbia basin.  The CBIP can be considered a highly engineered, man-made watershed that efficiently uses water to support crop production.  However, there is growing concern that wastewater flowing into the Columbia River contributes to the nitrate and phosphate load in the river leading to toxic algae blooms.  Normally, wastewater is channelized and fed directly into the river.  We propose and identify various sites along the river that can be modified or engineered to be natural filtration systems that can help protect the Columbia River water quality and preserve the cultural, economic, recreational, wildlife and fisheries benefits that clean water provides to our local economy. </p><br>
		
		<p>We base this concept on the similar Wetland, Riparian, Shrub-Steppe (WRSS) ecosystems that are found along tributaries to the Columbia and identify in the appendix many potential areas along the Hanford Reach and Lake Wallula that could be protected, rehabilitated or restored into an essential wastewater treatment system for the CBIP.  Further these sites can provide enhanced public recreation, provide wildlife habitat and migration corridors, provide wetlands for migratory fowl and enhance local fisheries.  Finally, we suggest a few initial sites to demonstrate the concept, that have minimal land ownership or usage conflicts and would require minimal engineering requirements that would hinder CBIP operation. </p><br>
