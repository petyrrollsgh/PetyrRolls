				<h3>General: </h3>
				<br>
				<p>The Benton City boat ramp is a small park and boat launch on the Yakima River. Plenty of parking is available predominately on gravel, but there are two ADA parking pads.  The picnic tables are accessible and should be in the shade most of the day.  One portable toilet is available although it may not be ADA accessible.  It is not clear if potable water is available at this site.  Camping is not permitted. </p>
				<p>it is a popular swimming spot with a couple of rope swings although one might be cautious about their integrity.  The current is swift enough that swimmers should be cautious about getting in too deep. The same is true of all the Yakima River <b</p>
				<p>The boat ramp is precast concrete slabs in good condition and suitable for all human-powered water craft as well as smaller motorized water craft.  The ramp angle is relatively mild and has a Water Access Rating (WAR) of 2 meaning that getting to the waterâ€™s edge requires a skilled wheelchair roller or minimal help from an able-bodied friend or two. </p>
				<br><br>
				<h3> Suggested Paddle: </h3>
				<br>
				<p>The paddle from Benton City to Horn Rapids Park (11 miles) is an ideal beginners paddle and should take 3-4 hours at a leisurely pace.  There is even a small riffle to make things feel exciting.  While the water is clean enough for swimming, drinking the water is not reccommended. As with most rivers in this area, the flow rate drops significantly after the middle of June and may be to low for continuous paddling by early September.  Upper Horn Rapids (River Mile 6.7) and Omaha Beach (River Mile 9.2) are convenient places to stop for a rest and also provide emergency access to highway 225.	</p>
