				<p>South of Ringold Spring are some interesting sites to note as you paddle by.  You can get out and explore but the best place of a long stop is Power Line Beach. </p>  
				<p>The first point of interest is the Ringold Wasteway (RM 352.5) landslide which occurred in 2006.  This is one example of how irrigation has destabilized the sediments along the river leading to sudden collapse as well as slow creep of the ground.  You can find further evidence of unstable ground south down to Carbody Beach (RM 346).</p>
				<p>Parsons Canyon (RM 352) is a large canyon complex extending inland about 1.5 miles.  It provides substantial habitat for wildlife.  The lands near the shoreline are owned by the U.S Army Corp of Engineers and are open to the public.  Lands further in are currently privately owned but there is preliminary interest in making the ravines open to the public and improving wildlife and riparian habitat through an agreement with the land owners.  Baxter canyon and Rankin canyon to the south offer similar opportunities.</p>
				<p>Power Line Beach (RM 351) is a pleasant place to stop and as it is owned by the USACE, the adjacent land is open to the public.  This spot is located in the Hidden Hills Habitat Management Unit which covers the flat lands to the north and up to the beginning of the hillside.  It is a good site for hiking, birding and other activities.</p>  
				<p>Further south one can find odd holes dug into the cliffs.  These are the Agate Mines (RM 350.5).  Baxter Canyon (RM 350) enters close by.  Although there is a gate on the road leading to the agate mines the road leads to Fir Rd. and this is a useful place for an emergency take-out.  More information on agate mining can be found at the
