				<p>The Bend HMU is actually named the Richland Bend HMU but this confuses many folks about its location.  It is on the Pasco side of the river.  Owned by the USACE it extends west of shoreline drive to the river.  It starts on the south end near the Central Pre-mix Concrete facility and extends north to the small inlet near Burns road.  All of this land is public property but the small dock and pumping station are privately owned.  Nearby residents will confront you about your presence on public land as they are under the impression that they have some right to control access.  If you do not use the dock (which is probably unsafe anyway) and donâ€™t mess with the pumping system, you are within your rights to be on this public property.  The author has used this as an emergency exit point when one of our trip members had physical issues.  If you wish to avoid confronting the locals, there is another small inlet downstream about 200 yards.  It has good parking and could be used to launch paddle craft with a bit of bushwacking.</p> 
				<p>While there is limited parking in the HMU there are no restroom facilities or other amenities.</p>
				<p>Further south the Bend HMU becomes more wetlands and is a popular destination for birdwatching as well as short hikes and getting a taste of nature.  Even if you are not paddling, the Bend HMU is one of the wildest places along the river but still near the city.  It is a valuable riparian habitat that protects the river from pollution and provides a home for wildlife. </p> 
				<p>The City of Pasco, in their Broadmoor development plan, states that the HMU will become a city park, Shoreline drive would become a major arterial (4-lanes?) and that extensive mixed residential and commercial development is planned on the east side of Shoreline drive.  This would endanger the HMU and ultimately destroy its riparian value.  It is worth protecting.</p>
				<p>We give the Bend HMU a WAR-3 rating as there is no wheelchair access that would not require the assistance of two able-bodied persons.</p>
